            Humanoid robots are now used as research tools in several scientific areas. Researchers study the human body
            structure and behavior (biomechanics) to build humanoid robots. On the other side, the attempt to simulate
            the human body leads to a better understanding of it. Human cognition is a field of study which is focused
            on how humans learn from sensory information in order to acquire perceptual and motor skills. This knowledge
            is used to develop computational models of human behavior and it has been improving over time. <br />
            <br />
            It has been suggested that very advanced robotics will facilitate the enhancement of ordinary humans. See
            transhumanism. <br />
            <br />
            Although the initial aim of humanoid research was to build better orthosis and prosthesis for human beings,
            knowledge has been transferred between both disciplines. A few examples are powered leg prosthesis for
            neuromuscularly impaired, ankle-foot orthosis, biological realistic leg prosthesis and forearm prosthesis.

            Besides the research, humanoid robots are being developed to perform human tasks like personal assistance,
            through which they should be able to assist the sick and elderly, and dirty or dangerous jobs. Humanoids are
            also suitable for some procedurally-based vocations, such as reception-desk administrators and automotive
            manufacturing line workers. In essence, since they can use tools and operate equipment and vehicles designed
            for the human form, humanoids could theoretically perform any task a human being can, so long as they have
            the proper software. However, the complexity of doing so is immense.
